# Courtois-NeuroMod: things.tsnr subdataset 
## Temporal signal-to-noise maps derived from things.fmriprep derivative dataset 

The [Courtois project on Neural Modelling (Courtois NeuroMod)](https://www.cneuromod.ca/) is an extensive dataset of individual human brain activity and behaviour.

The current subdataset is organized following the [brain imaging data structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) (including extensions in development) and contains:
- temporal signal-to-noise maps in NI152NLin2009cAsym and T1w volumetric space for each run completed by each subject
- a mean temporal signal-to-noise map in NI152NLin2009cAsym and T1w volumetric space averaged from every run for each subject

Courtois NeuroMod data are [freely shared with the scientific community](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/ACCESS.html) to advance research at the interface of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
